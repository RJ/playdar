Installation
============
This covers building from source specifically on Debian Linux.
Should be easy on other Linuxes too. 
Playdar also builds on Windows, using visual studio express.
Playdar also builds on Mac OS X (intel) using gcc + stuff from macports.


Linux Dependencies
------------------
Assuming ubuntu 9.04 (Otherwise find similarly named packages)
NB: You need boost libs version 1.35 or higher.
In a nutshell:

 # Your build environment:
 sudo apt-get install git-core cmake build-essential

 # Boost libs:
 sudo apt-get install libboost-thread1.37.0 libboost-system1.37.0 libboost-program-options1.37.0 libboost-regex1.37.0 libboost-filesystem1.37.0 libboost-date-time1.37.0

 # Boost headers:
 sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options1.37-dev libboost-regex1.37-dev libboost-system1.37-dev libboost-thread1.37-dev libboost1.37-dev

 # Needed by playdar core:
 sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libtag1-dev libcurl3 libcurl4-gnutls-dev

 # Needed by playdar audioscrobbler plugin:
 sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libssl-dev



Mac Dependencies
----------------
Using Leopard MacPorts:

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port upgrade installed
    sudo port install cmake boost taglib


Windows Dependenceies
---------------------
Good luck! Just install everything listed and hope for the best.
It is known to work.


Compile it:
-----------
If you've installed something in non-standard locations, look in CMakeLists.txt
at the include/library paths and make changes if need be.

NB: if you are using linux x86_64 read the notes near the top of CMakeLists.txt

 $ cd playdar
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..

Build the main app and the core plugins:

 $ make

Change back to the playdar top level dir:

 $ cd ..

First Run and Scanning
----------------------
Run the scanner to index your music and create the database:

 $ ./bin/scanner ./collection.db /your/mp3/dir


Running Playdar
---------------
Edit etc/playdar.conf and specify your name etc.
Run playdar from the top level playdar directory: 

    $ ./bin/playdar -c ./etc/playdar.conf

Now hit up: http://localhost:8888/ to check it's running.

Check out www.playdar.org for the latest demo interface to test it' working
or try playlick.com for a playlist app.
