Installation
============
This covers building from source specifically on Debian Linux.
Should be easy on other Linuxes too. 
Playdar also builds on Windows, using visual studio express.
Playdar also builds on Mac OS X (intel) using gcc + stuff from ports.


Linux Dependencies
------------------
Assuming debian/ubuntu. Otherwise find similarly named packages:

1) sudo apt-get install \
    sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev \
    cmake \
    libtag1-dev \
    libossp-uuid-dev libossp-uuid15

    NB: "libossp-uuid" is different to "libuuid" in debian. 
        make sure you install the correct uuid package.

    NB: if you defined LAME_UUIDS_PLEASE you don't need the uuid library.
        (it creates them using the cstdlib rand() function)

2) Need boost, but also boost::asio, which was only added to boost "recently".
   If your distro has >= boost 1.35 then install all the 1.35 boost packages
   you can find, including -dev versions, and it will work. Deb/Lenny has it.

   If your distro boost packages are < 1.35:
   Build boost from source. It's easy, but can take ~45mins to build. 
   See boost.org for latest version.
   NB: check the --layout option to configure, i missed this and it left 
       -gcc43-mt in the filenames, I ended up fixing it manually like this:
       $ cd /usr/local/lib
       $ for f in `ls libboo*-gcc43-mt.so`; do L=`echo $f \
         | sed 's/-gcc43-mt//'`; echo $L; ln -s $f $L; done


3) You need liburiparser 0.7.0 or higher. If you're running Ubuntu Hardy, 
   you'll have to install from source, Ibex has it in apt.


Mac Dependencies
----------------
Using Leopard MacPorts:

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port upgrade installed
    sudo port install cmake boost ossp-uuid uriparser taglib


Windows Dependenceies
---------------------
Good luck! Just install everything listed and hope for the best.


Compile it:
-----------
0) Look in CMakeLists.txt at the include/library paths and make changes if
   you've installed boost/something in unusual places.
1) 
    $ cmake .
2) 
    $ make


First Run and Scanning
----------------------
Make the empty database:

    $ sqlite3 ./collection.db < etc/schema.sql   #>

Now run the scanner to index your music:

    $ ./scanner ./collection.db /your/mp3/dir


Running Playdar
---------------
Edit etc/playdar.ini and specify your name, private ip etc.
Run playdar from the same directory you built it in: 

    $ ./bin/playdar -c ./etc/playdar.ini

FWIW you can also override ini file options on command line like this:

    $ ./bin/playdar -c ./etc/playdar.ini --resolver.udp_lan.enabled no

Now hit up: http://localhost:8888/ to check it's running.
Make JSON requests yourself, go to /stats, or more importantly:

Check out www.playdar.org for the latest demo interface.
