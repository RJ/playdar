ScrobSub 2
==========
A cross-platform plain-c library that allows you to submit scrobbles to Last.fm 
using the official Audioscrobbler application, or if that isn't installed,
independently.

Usage
=====
This does not compile to a dynamic library. You need to compile it into your
application. Indeed, (on Linux) this is duplication, but it's a very small
amount of code, and we provide many options for which libraries it uses.

You need to compile in scrobsub.c and one of the scrobsub-options.*

So pick whichever suits you, or write a new one (there's only a few functions to
reimplement) and submit it.

You also will need to define a number of preprocessor constants:

SCROBSUB_CLIENT_VERSION
SCROBSUB_CLIENT_ID
SCROBSUB_API_KEY
SCROBSUB_SHARED_SECRET

What these represent should be apparent once you have read: http://last.fm/api


Practical concerns
==================
The library is synchronous. If you don't want to block the thread that calls 
them, you will need to call these functions in a separate thread. Or you can
rely on the user installing the official Last.fm Audioscrobbler application:

#define SCROBSUB_ALWAYS_RELAY 1
