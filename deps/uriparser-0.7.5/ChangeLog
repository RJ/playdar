2009-03-04 -- 0.7.5

  * Added: pkg-config file
  * Fixed: File Doxyfile.in was missing from release archives
      Thanks to Rakesh Pandit for reporting!
  * Fixed: Doc generation troubles
  * Changed: No longer shipping bundled libcpptest
  * Changed: New dependencies:
      - libcpptest 1.1.0 or later
      - pkg-config (for libcpptest detection)
      Both dependencies can be disable through configuring
      with --disable-test, which excludes the test suite
      from compilation.

2008-12-23 -- 0.7.4

  * Fixed: Null pointer de-referencing when dissecting query
      strings starting with "&" right after "?" (#2418192).
      Thanks to Harvey Vrsalovic for reporting!
  * Fixed: Memory leak in uriFreeQueryList function (#2413066)
      Thanks to Daniel Chapiesky for reporting!
  * Fixed: Memory leak in uriNormalizeSyntax(Ex) functions (#2413066)

  * Improved: Nested configure hacks resolved

      Thanks to Sezai Tekin for reporting!
  * Fixed: uriparser now builds on Cygwin
  * Fixed: Now shipping gnulib's config.guess from HEAD
      which is suitable for Haiku (#2116355)
  * Changed: swprintf requirement resolved
  * Changed: Build system changes:
      - configure option --enable-doc added
      - configure.in renamed to configure.ac
      - some Autotools files moved to build-aux directory
  * Added: Qt Assistant documentation output:
      - Qt Compressed Help (.qch) at <doc/uriparser-doc-*.qch>
      - Qt Help Project (.qhp) at <doc/html/index.qhp>
      Generation requires Doxygen 1.5.7.1-20081103 or later.
  * Soname: 1:8:0

2008-09-01 -- 0.7.2

  * Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions
      - uriAddBaseUri(..)
      - uriRemoveBaseUri(..)
      Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code
      URI_ERROR_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now
      take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers
      from your side is still needed in case of success.

2008-04-27 -- 0.7.1

  * Fixed: Bogus syntax error when parsing URIs with port-like
      passwords, e.g. "http://user:21@host/" (#1948038)
      Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for reporting!
  * Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases,
      which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/"
      and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (#1950126)
      Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!

2008-04-04 -- 0.7.0

  * Added: Dissection and composition of query strings
  * Added: Documentation improvements

  * Added: Code::Blocks workspace file
  * Soname: 1:5:0

2008-02-25 -- 0.6.4

  * Added: Syntax-based normalization can now handle relative URIs,
      e.g. "../../a/b/.././c" is normalized to "../../a/c"
  * Fixed: Normalization code could free foreign memory
  * Fixed: Normalization processed the path segment even when asked not to
  * Added: MinGW Makefile and related readme
      Thanks to Michael Anthony Puls II!
  * Fixed: Documentation bug not requiring enough memory for the output
      buffer when converting a relative file URI back to a filename
  * Soname: 1:4:0

2008-02-11 -- 0.6.3

      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for the patch!
  * Added: Brief usage tutorial
  * Soname: 1:3:0

2008-02-08 -- 0.6.2

  * Fixed: Freeing a normalized URI like "http://test?"
      caused a crash. Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Filename <--> URI string conversion helpers can
      now handle relative URIs and filenames
  * Soname: 1:2:0

2007-12-23 -- 0.6.1

  * Fixed: Percent-encodings in hostnames were not repaired during normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Percent-encodings were fixed after dot removal not before during
      normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Include path order bug
      Thanks to Ed Schouten for reporting this!

2007-09-17 -- 0.6.0

  * Fixed: Proper soname updates from now on, starting at 1:0:0

2007-09-13 -- 0.5.2

  * Added: RemoveBaseUri function to create URI references
  * Added: Unix/Windows filename <--> URI string conversion helpers
  * Added: EscapeEx function to escape text blocks without zero termination
  * Fixed: Bug in ToString for URIs with scheme, path, but no host (e.g. "f:/.//g")
  * Fixed: AddBase now resolves ".//g" with base "f:/a" to "f:/.//g" instead of
      "f://g" which would result in "g" becoming the authority part when parsing
      a recomposition (ToString) of that URI structure. This is a whole in RFC 3986,
      see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.

2007-08-09 -- 0.5.1

  * Added: Syntax-based normalization
  * Added: Percent-encoding function Escape
  * Improved: Malloc/NULL checks added
  * Added: New function UnescapeInPlaceEx can also decode '+' to ' '
      and convert line breaks
  * Added: Exact space computation for ToString, see ToStringCharsRequired
  * Added: --enable-sizedown for saving space and slower code
  * Fixed: Two internal functions were exposed in the API by mistake:
      uriPushToStack and uriStackToOctet
  * Added: Visual Studio 2005 project files
  * Removed: Legacy code (removal was announced for 0.5.0)

  * Added: References resolution (think relative to absolute)
  * Added: Naive URI equality check
  * Added: URIs can now be converted back to strings
  * Fixed: The first path segment of a relative URI was eaten
      (functions ParseSegmentNz and ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)

      (function ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)
  * Improved: Test suite now built on "make check", not before
