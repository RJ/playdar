<span style="color:red;">Playdar has not been 'officially announced' yet, I am soliciting feedback before making a more public announcement. There's plenty to get excited about - please join the mailing list if you have any questions or comments!</span>
</p>
<p>
Playdar is a music content resolver service - run it on every computer you use,
and you'll be able to listen to all the songs you would otherwise be able to
find manually by searching though all your computers, hard disks, online 
services, and friends' music collections.
