<h2>Playdar Content Resolving Framework</h2>
<p>
The Playdar scanner creates a database of your "local library", ie music 
files that you have on your computer. It also maintains a text search index 
capable of fuzzy searching. You search for "Radiohed" it finds "Radiohead".
This is all stored in an sqlite database, with a custom ngram fuzzy-search implementation.
</p>
<p>
Fundamental to the design of Playdar is a pluggable, asynchronous content-
resolving framework. The following resolvers are already working:
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>Local library resolver</strong> - uses the fuzzy search index as mentioned above.
  If the song exists on your computer, this plugin finds it instantly.
  (Already works; sqlite with custom ngram indexing)
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Local area network resolver</strong> - find other Playdar installs on the LAN.
  This has the same restrictions as iTunes Shared Libraries - it will only work on your 
  home network or office network if there are no firewalls in the way.
  (Already works; UDP multicast)
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Remote Playdar connector</strong> - give it an IP:port of a remote computer running
  Playdar and you can resolve content from that machine too (eg: work~home). I'm using this over
  SSH tunnels at the moment to hook up home-work.
  (Already works; uses the Playdar HTTP API on remote machine directly)
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Gateway Plugin</strong> - Will spawn another binary/script, and pipe queries to it via stdin, and expect results from stdout.
  This means you can write resolver plugins in any language or shell script, provided you can parse and output JSON. 
  There is a (somewhat crappy) example php script which is capable of resolving one hardcoded track from magnatune.com.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Other resolver plugins...</h3>
<p>
What other sources can you think of to resolve music from? You can make a plugin using C++ that will load into Playdar directly, or in a language of your choice if you use the Gateway plugin and handle queries from stdin.
</p>
<p>
Here are some ideas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Searching free sources such as magnatune.com or archive.org</li>
    <li>Got a Rhapsody account? A resolver could use their API to play from Rhapsody</li>
    <li>iTunes shared libraries (not sure if this is possible due to silly encryption apple added?)</li>
    <li>UPnP Media Devices</li>
    <li>Any online service that has a search/streaming API</li>
    <li></li>
    <li><b>Your idea here</b></li>
</ul>
